For [[Bryan Johnson]], sleep is the number one priority in life. It's more important than anything else. When his sleep is on point, life feels amazing and possible. When he has bad sleep, everything feels challenging and miserable.

I completely agree with this and I am making modifications to my life to realize this. I'm removing any social obligations that happen after 7pm. 8pm is my new wind-down time and it is simply non-negotiable.

If people require my presence then they must schedule something during the day or before my bedtime. I won't participate in anything that happens after that. Of course life will require some exceptions to this sometimes, that is unavoidable. 

But I will do my best to structure my life around this and make sleep my number one priority. I have experienced myself that everything feels better when I sleep well.
