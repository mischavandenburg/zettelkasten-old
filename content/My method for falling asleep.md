This week I started experimenting with becoming more intentional about falling asleep instead of waiting for it to happen. I've also been listening to podcasts and audiobooks to help me drift off to sleep and that never sat very well with me. Sometimes I get engrossed with the material and it prevents me from falling asleep.

I'm a side sleeper but I will start by lying on my back and doing progressive relaxation of the body. Starting with the forehead and eyes and face, relaxing each and every muscle. Then moving down towards the torso and arms. 

I heard a queue somewhere "spread warm energy from your head to your fingers" and that is a very pleasant one to do.

When the torso and legs are completely relaxed I continue body scanning up and down the body. During this process the mind will wander off to worldly concerns but then I bring back to the body.

After a while of this I move over to my side and do anapanasati: mindfulness of breathing. Focusing on the breath at the nose tip while simultaneously holding the body in the mind as well. Then the mind usually becomes bright and I keep focussing on making the breath smaller and lighter and then I fall asleep.

It has worked well for a couple of nights now and I wonder how this is going to progress when I make it into a regular routine. It would be amazing to be able to fall asleep very quickly and regularly.
