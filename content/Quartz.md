This will be my version of rwxrob's zet repo. Although I keep a division between tech topics for Hugo and personal topics, I still want to publish my personal notes in a low-threshold fashion. The personal wordpress blog does not serve that need. It's still a bit of a hassle. I want to integrate it in the Zettelkasten method and that doesn't work with the wordpress setup, so I'll just use the personal blog for long-form content, discoverability and travel blogging when I do that. 

Actually that complements very nicely. The quartz can be pure zettelkasten, short form notes. 

The personal blog is the output of those notes: the more refined processed form.
