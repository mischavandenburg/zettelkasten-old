Writing is thinking. Translating concepts to your own words forces you to think about it, and if you find that you cannot put your thoughts into writing, it is a sign that you don't understand the subject matter clearly.

This is exactly why I keep a tech blog. I write notes about the stuff I learn and try to explain the topics in my own words. This may help others, but it also helps myself, because it is a great test for my own understanding.

>["It isn't enough to read, you also have to write, and if you're going to go to graduate school you should write every day. It's a good idea for anyone who wants to develop themselves intellectually. Even a half an hour a day, that's 180 hours a year. That's a lot of thinking, because writing is thinking."](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=4498d06252fbdf03JmltdHM9MTcwNjc0NTYwMCZpZ3VpZD0wNGFhOTJhZi1iZTBmLTYxYjMtMGQwNy04MTU4YmYwMjYwMmMmaW5zaWQ9NTg4Ng&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=04aa92af-be0f-61b3-0d07-8158bf02602c&psq=jordan+peterson+quote+about+writing&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9qb3JkYW5wZXRlcnNvbnF1b3Rlcy5jb20vdGFnL3dyaXRpbmcvcGFnZS8yLw&ntb=1)

[(20) Dr Jordan B Peterson on X: "If you can think, and speak, and write, you are absolutely deadly. Writing is thinking formalized. You gain the ability to think by first learning to write very, very carefully. Then, when you can write effectively, you can do anything you want, and no one will stop you. https://t.co/uVvrPdC5n5" / X (twitter.com)](https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/1413182150984208394)

> If you can't say it clearly, you don't understand it yourself." - John Searle
