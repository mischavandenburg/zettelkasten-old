# What is a Zettelkasten?

Zettelkasten is a system of note taking and personal knowledge management. [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) means "slip box" in German. Traditionally it is a physical box of slips of paper or index cards containing smaller notes. Each of these cards have a unique identifier, and these identifiers are used to create links between the cards.

It was invented by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) who was one of the most prolific scholars in history. He wrote 70 books and nearly 400 academic articles, and he credited the Zettelkasten with making his productivity possible. It contained around 90,000 index cards.

I first came across this concept by reading the book [How to take Smart Notes](https://amzn.to/49Pcimg) by SÃ¶nke Ahrens.
