Welcome. I've been keeping a Zettelkasten for about 3 years now, and I've accumulated nearly 2500 notes. And I enjoy reading other people's Zettelkasten too, such as rwxrob's. It shows me what they're currently obsessed with or working on, and I like to follow their journeys in that way.

Publishing my writing to the world started with my [tech blog](https://mischavandenburg.com). I wrote about my journey into DevOps and what I was learning along the way, and found it to be an enjoyable practice. Later I approached it more like a Zettelkasten too, including personal notes and writing about my non-technical hobbies and obsessions. But eventually I felt it was better to keep it more accessible and readable for people interested in reading my technical content and for recruiters and hiring managers to have a good browsing experience.

Quartz seems like a fun way to publish my personal Zettelkasten to the world. I think the publication aspect will help me to keep a more strict Zettelkasten methodology. My notetaking system has always been based on Niklas Luhmann's method of Zettelkasten, but after recently re-reading [How to Take Smart Notes](https://amzn.to/49Pcimg) I realized I had drifted farther than I liked. Publishing my Zettels will also force me to start keeping an index or maintaining Maps of Content, because they will be the only way to provide some useful initial structure to the reader. I don't really need them for my own notetaking and retrieval experience, but Luhmann kept elaborate indexes of his Zettelkasten, mainly because he didn't have the luxury of digital search like I have. (See [[How Luhmann Organized his Zettelkasten]])

However, if you are interesed in following me I suggest you [add this blog to your preferred RSS reader ](https://zettelkasten.mischavandenburg.net/index.xml) instead so you get regular updates. That's how I follow the people I'm most interested in.
