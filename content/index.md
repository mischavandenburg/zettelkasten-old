title: Mischa's Public Zettelkasten
---

I enjoy reading other people's Zettelkasten, such as rwxrob's. It shows me what they're currently obsessed with or working on, and I like to follow their journeys in that way.

It all started with my [tech blog](https://mischavandenburg.com). I started blogging about my journey into DevOps and found it to be an enjoyable practice. Later I approached it more like a Zettelkasten too, including personal notes and writing about my non-technical hobbies and obsessions. But eventually I felt it was better to keep it more accessible and readable for people interested in reading my technical content and for recruiters and hiring managers to have a good experience.

Quartz seems like a fun way to publish my personal Zettelkasten to the world. I do intend to keep a more strict Zettelkasten methodology, publishing small notes and linking them together. This will also force me to start keeping an index or maintaining Maps of Content, because they will be the only way to provide some useful structure to the reader.

However, if you are interesed in following me I suggest you [add this blog to your preferred RSS reader ](https://zettelkasten.mischavandenburg.net/index.xml) instead so you get regular updates. That's how I follow the people I'm most interested in.
